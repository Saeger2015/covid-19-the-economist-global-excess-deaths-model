# The Economist's excess deaths model 
This repository contains the replication code and data for The Economist's excess deaths model, used to estimate the true death toll of covid-19 pandemic.  

  
  
To replicate the model and export estimated excess deaths for a locality, please run the scripts 1, 2, and 3, in the scripts folder. As the model draws most of its data dynamically, you can use these scripts to generate updated estimates.
  

  
To read about what the model shows, see: TK   
To read how we made it, see: TK   

  
A special thanks to all our sources and to those who have made the data to create these estimates available. Within script 1, the source for each variable is given as the data is loaded.
